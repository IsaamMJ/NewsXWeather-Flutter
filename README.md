Project Documentation: Weather and News Aggregator App with Weather-Based News Filtering

App Overview
The app I’ve developed is a Weather and News Aggregator App with Weather-Based News Filtering. The app combines weather updates with news articles, filtered based on the current weather conditions.

Step 1: Research and Exploration
I began by researching similar apps in the market. However, I couldn't find any app that perfectly matched my concept. So, I expanded my research to explore existing news and weather apps to gather UI/UX inspiration.

Step 2: Branding
For the branding, I needed to choose a brand name, logo, and color palette. After a detailed search, I decided on the name SKYFEED. Most news apps typically use a strong red color and weather apps use blue, but I chose not to combine both colors. Instead, I selected my own color palette to ensure a unique and aesthetic appeal.

Step 3: Folder Structure
For the development phase, I decided on a feature-based folder structure with a clean architecture approach to ensure modularity and maintainability throughout the app.

Step 4: Technologies and Tools
For the app development, I will be using the following tools and libraries:

GetX for state management.

Shared Preferences for storing local data.

Firebase for user authentication.
